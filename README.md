# ImageProcessing


As part of the lecture offered by Kal from Kal academy, this project was provided as an exercise. I borrowed heavily from Vishnu's code (https://github.com/vishsram/ImageProcessing) so that I could follow along and understand the problem and one possible solution before mucking about in it myself.

Many thanks, Vishnu!
