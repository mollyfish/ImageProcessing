# ImageProcessing
Image Processing takes a tiff image and processes it into a blurred image upto given number of iterations and applies Sobel's edge detection algorithm to detect edges.

As part of the lecture offered by Kal from Kal academy, this project was provided as an exercise. I have implemented various methods such as boxBlur(), getBlurValue(), sobelEdges(), getGradValue(), setPixel(), ToString(), and impletemented class declaration, object construction, etc.
